# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** January 4, 2025

## Introduction

Welcome to HydraFlow! This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and protect your data while using our services. By interacting with HydraFlow, you agree to the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy.

## Data We Collect

HydraFlow collects data as part of its workflow processes, specifically:

- **User ID:** A unique identifier generated for workflow management. This is not tied to your real identity.
- **Chatroom ID:** A unique identifier for session tracking, generated for each interaction.
- **Workflow Data:** Includes task cards, memories, subtasks, and other records related to workflow execution.
- **Feedback Entries:** Your feedback, ratings, and timestamps, which are used to improve HydraFlow's features.
- **System Context:** Data about workflow efficiency and optimization tasks.

### Anonymity
HydraFlow generates User IDs and Chatroom IDs randomly and cannot associate these with specific individuals. This means that, while your workflow data is stored, it cannot be traced back to you.

## How We Use Your Data

HydraFlow uses the collected data solely to:

1. Facilitate task management workflows, including creating and tracking task cards, subtasks, and memories.
2. Analyze workflow efficiencies and suggest improvements.
3. Collect feedback to improve system performance and user satisfaction.
4. Ensure the functionality and security of the platform.

### Data Retention
- **User Data:** Retained for the duration of its relevance to active workflows.
- **Feedback Entries:** Retained to analyze trends and improve system capabilities.
- **Task Data:** Retained for historical performance analysis and workflow optimization.

## Data Deletion

Given the random generation of User IDs and Chatroom IDs, HydraFlow cannot identify specific data upon request.

## Third-Party Services

HydraFlow interacts with Supabase for database management. Supabase has its own privacy policy and security measures. HydraFlow ensures that data passed to Supabase is handled according to the policies outlined here.

## Security Measures

We take data security seriously and implement the following measures:

- Role-Level Security (RLS) to restrict unauthorized access.
- HTTPS for encrypted data transmission.
- Regular audits of database policies and access logs.

## User Rights

While HydraFlow strives to protect your data, please note:
- You cannot request data specifically tied to your identity as we cannot trace User IDs or Chatroom IDs to real users.
- You may request a copy of general usage logs without personal identifiers.

## Updates to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected in the repository, and you are encouraged to review the policy periodically.

## Contact Information

If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or how we handle your data, please reach out via the repository's issue tracker or contact the HydraFlow support team.
